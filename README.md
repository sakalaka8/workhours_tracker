# workhours_tracker
Simple app for tracking every day worhours.

It's my first project with Python. For learning with Python I will make a simple app for tracking every day workhours.
In the app you will enter the number of hours you spent in the working day. The data will be stored in a .csv file in the form of four columns: Date, Day, Week number and Work hours.

## To do
- main program with python to save data in csv file
- simple gui for better usage
